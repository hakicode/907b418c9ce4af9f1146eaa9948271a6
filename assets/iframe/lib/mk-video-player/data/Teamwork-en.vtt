0:00:02.290 --> 0:00:08.130
My friend and I had to clean a room.

0:00:08.130 --> 0:00:16.110
While I knew how to sweep the floor, my friend
knew how to mop the floor.

0:00:16.110 --> 0:00:21.550
I asked my friend to mop the floor after I
was done with sweeping it.

0:00:21.550 --> 0:00:26.143
However, he said that for better cleaning,
he would mop the floor first and then I should

0:00:26.143 --> 0:00:27.160
sweep it.

0:00:27.160 --> 0:00:30.810
I couldn't understand his logic, and we had
a discussion over it.

0:00:30.810 --> 0:00:35.620
Later I thought it would make sense to adjust
and go ahead with what he suggested.

0:00:35.620 --> 0:00:39.430
However, his condition was to sweep the floor,
immediately after he mops it.

0:00:39.430 --> 0:00:45.210
I told him that it would not only just dirty
the wet floor, but also spoil the broom

0:00:45.210 --> 0:00:49.700
and it was not acceptable to me and asked
him to clean the room all by himself.

0:00:49.700 --> 0:00:52.800
And he went ahead with cleaning the room all
by himself.

0:00:52.800 --> 0:00:58.380
Whenever we undertake any teamwork, we need
to put an end to our argument at some point

0:00:58.380 --> 0:00:59.820
and adjust,
appreciate viewpoints of others, and

0:00:59.820 --> 0:01:04.690
if we are unable to do so, then we may end
up having to do the entire work alone and

0:01:04.690 --> 0:01:07.060
will never be able to be a part of bigger
projects

0:01:07.060 --> 0:01:10.070
Only a big team can complete bigger projects
and work.

0:01:10.070 --> 0:01:15.490
Just the way small parts make one big engine
and that is how it functions,

0:01:15.490 --> 0:01:20.890
and the lubricant added helps it move and
function.

0:01:20.890 --> 0:01:23.390
Similarly, many people work on a particular
task/ project,

0:01:23.390 --> 0:01:28.040
good relation, and respect for and with each
other act as a lubricant for smooth functioning,

0:01:28.040 --> 0:01:29.200
working and task completion.

0:01:29.200 --> 0:01:37.170
If there is a sharp needle in the engine on
the rubber belt, it will harm and start cutting

0:01:37.170 --> 0:01:38.630
the rubber belt.

0:01:38.630 --> 0:01:47.050
In the same way, in teamwork, if one team
member turns out to be aggressive, proud,

0:01:47.050 --> 0:01:50.730
reluctant and egoistic, it will threaten the
team and teamwork.

0:01:50.730 --> 0:01:55.700
'What I say is always right', ' My experience
and understanding is better than yours' and

0:01:55.700 --> 0:01:59.549
similar statement to prove oneself right and
others wrong,

0:01:59.549 --> 0:02:00.979
are things which can hinder teamwork.

0:02:00.979 --> 0:02:11.980
There may be instances where one person may
not be able to get along with another, and

0:02:11.980 --> 0:02:16.150
cannot work together with that person,
in such situations, one should understand

0:02:16.150 --> 0:02:19.269
that comfort zone only exists in places like
heaven,

0:02:19.269 --> 0:02:25.919
or they should go to a place where they get
along with everyone and where everyone share

0:02:25.919 --> 0:02:26.919
the same thinking.

0:02:26.919 --> 0:02:30.909
We live in a world where different kind of
people live, who think differently and live

0:02:30.909 --> 0:02:34.620
differently,
if one wants to live in this world, one has

0:02:34.620 --> 0:02:39.700
to learn to stay with harmony with each other
which is the basic requirement.

0:02:39.700 --> 0:02:48.969
If one cannot adjust, then one may chose heaven
or some place where everyone's thinking is

0:02:48.969 --> 0:02:49.969
alike.

0:02:49.969 --> 0:02:53.769
Sometimes we have to learn to adjust, irrespective
of the fact whether right or wrong,

0:02:53.769 --> 0:02:58.799
for teamwork, we have to forego our obsessions,
we should learn to accept both praise and

0:02:58.799 --> 0:03:14.919
appreciation with a pinch of salt,
only then will work be done.
